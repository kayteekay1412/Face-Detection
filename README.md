# Face-Detection
# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using the OpenCV library in Python. It captures video from the webcam, processes each frame to detect faces, and highlights them with rectangles. Ideal for beginners learning computer vision and OpenCV.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.
- Displays detected faces in a live video stream from the webcam.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code, perfect for beginners.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Installation

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-detection.git
   cd real-time-face-detection
  ```

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python face_detection.py
```
Press q to quit the video stream.

## Acknowledgements
- This project uses the OpenCV library.
- Inspired by various OpenCV tutorials and documentation.
